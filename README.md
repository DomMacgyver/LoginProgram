# LoginProgram
Nickname: Monster 

This program consists of two halves. The server side with "server.java" as the main executable and the client side with "loginpage.java" as the main executable. This program creates a login interface which stores hashed passwords and allows users to gain acces to a Jframe page of the programmer's choice, only when logged in. This prgogram was coded in java and utilizes the Spring Layout in JFrame. It is very graphics oriented and features red asterisks that appear next to text boxes when not filled in correctly with a note on why it is not correct. It also uses the Sping Layout to create a set of Jframes that look correct wehn rezized to any practical(large enough to contain the physical elements) dimensions.

SpringUtilities.java, PasswordAuthentication.java, and all .jars are public domain and not produced by myself.
