# LoginProgram
Nickname: Monster - 
This program consists of two halves. The server side with "server.java" as the main executable and the client side with "loginpage.java" as the main executable. This program creates a login interface which stores hashed passwords and allows users to gain acces to a Jframe page of the programmer's choice, only when logged in. This prgogram was coded in java and utilizes the Spring Layout in JFrame.
SpringUtilities.java as well as all .jars are public domain and not produced by myself.
