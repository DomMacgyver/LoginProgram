# LoginProgram
Nickname: Monster - 
This program consists of two halves. The server side with server as the main executable and the client side with loginpage as the main executable. This program creates a login interface which stores hashed passwords and allows users to gain acces to a Jframe only when logged in. This prgogram was coded in java and utilizes the Spring Layout in JFrame.
SpringUtilities.java as well as all .jars were not made by me.
